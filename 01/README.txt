elf_calories.py reads the data.txt file and creates a list for each elf,
containing the calories they have. (elf_calories)

all the elf lists are elements in a list. (all_elves_calories)

each elf_calories list is summed and the total is appended to totals. (totals)

the highest total is found using the max() function.
