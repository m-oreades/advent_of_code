elf_calories.py reads the data.txt file and creates a list for each elf,
containing the calories they have. (elf_calories)

all the elf lists are elements in a list. (all_elves_calories)

each elf_calories list is summed and the total is appended to totals. (totals)

the highest total is found using the max() function.


elf_calories_top_three.py is the same except it adds the total to a list
(top_three)

the highest total is removed from the total list and the highest value is found
again. in this case this finds the top 3 values.

the top three are then summed together.
